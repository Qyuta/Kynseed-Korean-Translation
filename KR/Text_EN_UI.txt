UI_FamilyLedger_Orders_Help |= Each family member has their own page in this section, though babies cannot be given orders, you monster.\nSimply choose which thing you want them to do and click in the empty sections of the scheduler. You can drag-click to cover multiple sections. Simply click again to blank a filled section if you want it empty.
UI_FamilyLedger_Gathering_Help |= Gathering expeditions let you send your family members, except babies, out into the world to collect valuable items and maybe even to learn something!\nThe Vale is the default region as it is safe and familiar to all, but you can change this to send them off to other places that you have discovered. Be aware, though; kids cannot go into perilous areas such as Simplewood - much too dangerous!\nThe stars underneath the Destination name show the maximum Star Rating of the items that the Gatherer can bring back at the end of an expedition to that region. The number of stars is increased with the Gatherer's Experience. Some experience is gained each time a region is visited, but the amount gained depends on the person's success (if in a Perilous area) and upon their Mood - they will learn much more quickly if they are happy about going! \nThe Gatherer's Stats are listed on the right-hand page. Stats that are relevant to success in the selected destination region are highlighted. If these seem particularly low, then it may be better to raise these stats - temporarily with the Meal from the Outfit, or permanently by completing Orders - before sending the Gatherer to that Destination.\nStats that have been temporarily improved will be shown in green, whereas those that have been lowered will be red.\nThe three Outfit slots allow you to give equipment and food to the Gatherer to help with their expedition and give some control over the items that they bring back.\nThe first two slots are for tools - each tool allows the Gatherer to collect any five items that you would be able to collect when using that tool in the selected Destination region.\nIf nothing is placed in the tool slots, then the Gatherer will return with up to ten items that can be collected by hand: flowers, fruit or herbs.\nThe three Health Hearts show the Gatherer's fitness for combat. One Heart is lost each time a person is injured when fighting monsters. After three serious injuries, the Gatherer will return home in a bad mood and will take to their bed until fully recovered. Of course, you can give them 'get well soon' presents while they are there.\nFinally, the Progress bar shows how long the Gatherer will be away from home. Once they've set off, there is no calling them back - so be sure you can spare them for a while before you send them!

UI_Progress_Story_Desc_A_Prologue |= My idyllic childhood. I explored. I made friends. I had strange and disturbing dreams. Growing up on the farm is lovely. I miss my pals back at The Shoe, but you can't beat a full larder, your bed, and your family. I am very lucky.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_A_MeetTwig |= I met Twig. He's a strange but friendly boy with the ears of a rabbit, which he'd somehow acquired following a deal he made with a certain 'Mr Fairweather'. Twig is a Master of Fishing and has been Goddess-blessed. I hope to learn all his fishing skills one day. He can keep the rabbit ears, though.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_A_MeetHubbard |= I visited Candlewych Cottage and chatted with Old Mother Hubbard. She is a legendary cook - a Master. I didn't get to sample her cooking, but she did encourage me to attain her skills. Her house smelled wonderful and made me hungry. She has a huge dog that seems to move its lips when Old Mother Hubbard talks. Most curious.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_A_Summertide |= The Vale has a custom every ten years, which involves choosing an area of the Vale and two people from within it. The Goddesses then select someone to pick one of their fellow villagers to sacrifice to ensure future safety and prosperity.\nI was the one chosen to pick who should be sacrificed. It was between Old Jacob Crackle and Ginger Nutt from the Burial Grounds. I didn't want to choose, but I did. The villagers loved me for it. I should have felt bad, but it felt like the right thing to do at the time.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_A_Fairweather |= I had a 'dream' in which Twig led me to meet Mr Fairweather. He had talked to me before, but I actually saw him this time, and he was both scary and enchanting.\nIn this dream, I made an agreement for the Kynseed, which will let my spirit live on through my family for generations to come. When I woke, I discovered the dream was real.\nThe feelings within me are intoxicating. I can now speak with the Fae and kind-of live forever! I am determined to do my best and not fear anymore. This may also help me in my future quests and challenges.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_B_PostPrologue |= My adventure truly begins. The world waits to greet me with open arms. Who will I become? Can I fulfil a legacy as told to me? Can I use my powers to avenge our parents' horrible deaths at the jaws of the beast? That quest starts right now.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_B_PlantKynseed |= I planted the Kynseed and began the contract. My body felt energised, and my mind raced with possibilities. The Kynseed calls to me, and I feel its roots entwined within me. This feels like the beginning of a long adventure, and I can't wait.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_B_Jogon |= I met a huge man. A man with many scars, both physical and mental. Despite his appearance and tough demeanour, he is a good character, and his heart is pure. I learned how to fight and defend myself. He has many skills to teach, and I look forward to putting evil to the sword and gaining many riches in the process.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_B_Moon |= I was in Drownhill, to the east, when I met Moon. She is an accomplished and, dare I say it, rather beautiful Master of Archery. Once I passed her test, she taught me the use of a bow. She even gave me my own! Using a bow is great for stunning enemies and buying time. Soon, I will be able to shoot the fly off a nut at 50 paces!
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_B_Grandmasters |= I opened a huge stone door in The Circle and went deep inside. I was astounded to find three spirits there. Again, I was not scared at all. Everything seemed in order. They told me to look in the Mirryr, and a strange glassy object arose from a pool of brilliant blue. I could hear whisperings - I am sure it was the Goddesses judging me!\nI was told I had more potential than anyone and was given a quest. A quest close to my heart. I must kill the Jabberwock! To do so, though, I must first earn my status as someone worthy of wielding the one weapon that can kill it!
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_C_Tier1 |= I gained enough Rep to fill the Reputation Urn and returned to the Grandmasters. They were happy to see me and gave me the Torc of Return, so I can now quickly get back to see them.\nI really like them. You can tell they were great heroes once.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_C_MissingChickens |= Something had been scaring off people's chickens around Vale. I found them all hiding away and returned them home. The ghastly Jabberwock is causing mischief, and sightings of Hobs outside the dark forests are increasing!
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_D_Tier2 |= The Urn filled again! This gathering of renown makes me feel like I am progressing in life and improving. I was given another helpful item - the Rainstick! I can create a downpour with just a shake, which is handy for watering crops.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_D_Totem |= I went to see Marshtyt, the Master Gardener, who was troubled by a disturbing object. It would seem the Hags are placing evil totems around, making the Hobs go crazy and stripping a region of all its resources.\nI had to enter strange rifts to shut them down before destroying the totem. The reward was great, but these totems are troubling and probably only the start of something worse...
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_D_Marshtyt |= After destroying the dark totem, I met Marshtyt. He is quite a fellow with a mischievous sense of humour. Some may think his sauciness is outdated, but I think he is fantastic fun. Maybe I'm from another era?! I can learn many helpful gardening skills from him and use his garden whenever needed. If I can fix his greenhouses for him, I can even use those and get the blueprint to build my own!
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_D_MissingChild |= I received a letter about a missing child. She was kidnapped and taken to Simplewood.\nI prepared myself for a dangerous run and entered the forest. I battled through and found the child - who transformed into a Hag! It was a trick! I slew the evil, nasty Hag and swore to be more vigilant next time.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_E_Tier3 |= My reputation spreads like the smoothest butter. This is no grind at all! There are many ways to get more REP - combat, shops, tasks, and friendships. I'm told that 'the world is my oyster', but I do not know what oysters are! I heard they were ancient transport tokens.\nMore excitingly, though, I was given a new Lens for my Obscura, which will take me somewhere outside Quill!
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_E_TirNaNog |= Using the Obscura and my new Lens, I entered the portal at the henge and appeared in a wonderful land filled with excitable Fairies, jovial Gnomes and amazing fruits. There are games to play, a shop and the Tinker. A lively tour guide offered to show me the sights. Tir Na Nog is so beautiful and fun. I hope to visit more often.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_F_Tier4 |= As my stature grows, the Grandmasters seem to get even more hopeful. I don't want to disappoint them. They gave me the Deep Mine Key to delve deeper for ores. I must be careful, though. The Knockers live in the deep mines and don't like intruders! I better put on my best running boots.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_F_JabberwockEncounter |= I was walking into Stone Crown and was hit by a sudden storm. A terrible shadow appeared, and when I looked, I saw it! The Jabberwock! Finally, I felt fear in my heart. The beast was enormous and gave me a chilling roar - almost a warning.\nAnd just like that, it stomped off into Toughwood. I still have gooseberries from the encounter. To defeat that monster will take a tremendous amount of bravery.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_F_Lyric |= I tried to enter Woemarsh, but an unnatural fog stopped my progress. I met an interesting inhabitant of Woemarsh, and she sent me to seek Lyric in Ferrous Footway. I opened the door and made my way inside. I could hear Lyric playing strange but exciting music. She is truly amazing, if a bit rude. I played music with her, and she gave me the Calmonica to help clear the fog.\nI can't get her music out of my head.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_F_ClearFog |= I cleared the fog with the Calmonica and spoke to Paige Turner, the resident know-it-all of Woemarsh. She told me that the villagers were suffering from some sort of curse being carried in the only freshwater source, which made them all really hateful.\nI entered Dreadwaters, home of Daddy Long Legs, a terrifying character, and used three switches to access a tomb. Within, I cleansed the poisoned well with Blessed Water from Tir Na Nog. The people of Woemarsh were free - and much happier!
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_G_Tier5 |= I am steadily gaining fame, and my inner power increases. The Grandmasters seemed to be very excitable for long-dead people.\nIn exchange for my progress, they gave me another Lens! This one leads to another Fae realm. I can't wait to see it!
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_G_Evergreen |= I used the Lens of my Obscura to open the doorway to Evergreen. It was as incredible as I'd hoped. There is a strange atmosphere when you go near the trees, and you must take care. The inhabitants are very tall and beautiful.\nThere is a shop in Evergreen run by a Faun, and there are secret little glades. I hope to return there soon, especially as there are many hard-to-see but beneficial plants to gather.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_G_FoolMeTwice |= The Hags got me with the old 'fake letter' trick. This time, it was to recover a family heirloom. When I got to the glade of Midwood, a sword in the ground turned into a Hag!\nThe fight was fierce, but I prevailed.\nI really must stop falling for these tricks. I would say they will be the death of me, but I guess I have the Kynseed and Mr Fairweather...
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_H_Tier6 |= Another level of renown gained!\nMy confidence is high, and everyone is pleased with my progress.\nTo aid my adventures, I was given the Blizzard Staff. Now I can create snowy conditions even in the middle of summer! Handy for certain item Star Ratings!
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_H_DeadConcert |= Well, that was something! My ears are still ringing.\nI was tasked with putting some spirits at rest after evil forces awakened them. I had to round up an ancient band of musicians and fix a stage so they could perform a concert of what can only be described as brain-melting music. Lyric helped us out, and she loved it. She's a natural star.\nWe exorcised the ghosts and gave them peace through loud noise.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_I_Tier7 |= My power and reputation grow like the Kynseed tree. My branches now wind their way throughout Quill. I was given a curious Music Box in return for the full Urn.\nIt seems to have a connection to The Dancers at the western edge of Mellowfields. The tune it plays is very creepy, but I feel slightly refreshed for having heard it. Refreshed, but incomplete.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_I_BuryingPast |= I am at a loss for words, really.\nI discovered a secret chest buried on the farm and Uncle Bill's confession. I am not sure what to think of him. What was there to fear from sacrifice? Isn't it the way of things? It may not be the right way, and maybe the Goddesses will be called to account one day, but he lacked what they called 'chivalry'. I don't want this secret to sour our family's fond memories of his big daft bearded face.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_J_Tier8 |= An Expert am I!\nThe Grandmasters were so proud and enthused. I bet Mr Fairweather is also very excited about my development. The gift I received this time was the Lightning Rod. I can command storms to my will! On a cooldown, of course! The face-off with the Jabberwock draws near!
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_J_ThirdTimeUnlucky |= I kind of knew this would happen. Another summons to a dark forest. This time it was Toughwood to rescue a cow.\nA cow!\nOf course, I didn't fall for such nonsense, and it was an excellent chance to kill the last of the three sisters. She was a Night Hag and as wicked as they come. When I defeated her, I felt the land sigh in relief. Hags still exist, of course, but these three were the worst of the worst.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_K_Tier9 |= Another big step. I haven't been doing any major quests lately, but my renown has grown through various means, and here I am, on the threshold of legendary status. The battle with the Jabberwock is close now. It fills my dreams, and the lust for revenge drives me forward. I MUST gain that sword! I WILL kill it!\nIn other news, I got another Lens from the Grandmasters, and helped one of the villagers find their favourite lost radish... But another Fae realm awaits!
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_K_Voide |= I shone the Lens at the last Henge doorway and stepped into a place like no other. I was among the stars, which swirled around me and glittered so brilliantly.\nI met bizarre creatures who had taken over the suits of a long-dead race of technologically advanced beings. There were new plants and a fantastic ore of incredible durability. The place may be bizarre, but it was also tinged with sadness. An air of long-forgotten majesty permeated the cold air. I was glad to get out of there.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_K_SwordMould |= This was quite an adventure! I was tasked with getting the Vorpal Sword Mould and fixing the giant bridge in The Circle to access the north. Lyric helped me by giving me a bell with which to summon her father. Lyric is a star! Literally a star child!\nI went to Voide, met Jack-of-All-Trades, and gained the material needed to fix the bridge.\nIn the north, I had to open a tomb door (again), and inside, a book warned me about the guardian of the Mould. At first, it seemed like an old lady, but Shuffling Nana was a cosmic horror from deepest nightmares! I flung the garlic as instructed, and her vanishing scream still haunts me - but I gained the Mould.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_L_Tier10 |= A Legend! At last!\nAll our toils have led to this moment when I can forge the sword and take on the Jabberwock, the creature which kills those dearest to us and brings hatred to the land. I also gained the Hammer of the Ancients, which makes building much easier!\nOnwards!
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_L_ForgeSword |= I needed a particular ore to forge the sword with. Yet another step keeping me from revenge and freeing the land of evil tyranny.\nMy twin helped me locate the ore, and with Old Mother Hubbard's help, I cooked a pie to feed to a dreadful creature - the Wyrm.\nI was allowed to pass by Daddy Long Legs and fed the Wyrm the pie in the darkest, most fearful depths. It ate the pie, and I gained the Abysstone to forge the sword, which I did at the first opportunity. The blade feels light in my hand - almost fragile. With this weapon and courage, I will destroy the evil tormenting Toughwood.
UI_Progress_Story_Desc_L_JabberwockSlay |= The Jabberwock is dead.\nI have cemented my place as a hero and legend! The land is free from that foul beast's grasp. There is not much more to say. I shall live my life satisfied. I have avenged our family. I will tend to my farm. Decorate it. Fill in my collections. Love my kin.\nI shall live every day as though it is my last.\nThe Kynseed calls.
